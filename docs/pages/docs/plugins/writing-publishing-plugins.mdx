title: Writing a Publishing Plugin
---

The main use for plugins is to automate your release process.
This page will walk you through implementing the `git-tag` plugin.

> It is recommended that you use TypeScript for the best development experience.
> `auto` is written in TypeScript and has extensive jsDoc comments throughout the code.
> To make the following code work without compilation, just remove the types!

## Setup

First create a file for your plugins.

> Make sure to set the name! It must be consistent with your packages name.

**`my-plugin.ts`:**

```ts
import { Auto, IPlugin } from "@auto-it/core";

export default class GitTagPlugin implements IPlugin {
  /** The name of the plugin */
  name = "my-git-tag";

  /** Tap into auto plugin points. */
  apply(auto: Auto) {}
}
```

## Tap Required Hooks

Plugins work by "hooking" into various parts of `auto` to control or add to its behavior.
The following hooks you must implement to get a publishing plugin working.

### `getPreviousVersion`

This plugin will manage the version of the project solely using the tag.
Set up this hook to tell `auto` the last release version of your project

```ts
export default class GitTagPlugin implements IPlugin {
  // ...
  apply(auto: Auto) {
    /** Get the latest tag in the repo, if none then the first commit */
    async function getTag() {
      try {
        return await auto.git!.getLatestTagInBranch();
      } catch (error) {
        return auto.prefixRelease("0.0.0");
      }
    }

    auto.hooks.getPreviousVersion.tapPromise(this.name, getTag);
  }
}
```

### `version`

In this hook you should increment the version of your project, tag it, and if necessary commit a file (ex: `package.json`).

```ts
import { inc, ReleaseType } from "semver";

export default class GitTagPlugin implements IPlugin {
  // ...
  apply(auto: Auto) {
    // ...
    auto.hooks.version.tapPromise(this.name, async ({ bump }) => {
      const lastTag = await getTag();
      const newTag = inc(lastTag, version as ReleaseType);

      if (newTag && dryRun) {
        console.log(newTag);
        return;
      }

      if (!newTag) {
        auto.logger.log.info("No release found, doing nothing");
        return;
      }

      const prefixedTag = auto.prefixRelease(newTag);

      auto.logger.log.info(`Tagging new tag: ${lastTag} => ${prefixedTag}`);
      await execPromise("git", [
        "tag",
        prefixedTag,
        "-m",
        `"Update version to ${prefixedTag}"`,
      ]);
    });
  }
}
```

### `publish`

Finally publish your new version to a package management platform and push the new tag to GitHub.
In the case of the `git-tag` plugin pushing the tag to GitHub is the only thing we need to do.

```ts
export default class GitTagPlugin implements IPlugin {
  // ...
  apply(auto: Auto) {
    // ...
    auto.hooks.publish.tapPromise(this.name, async () => {
      auto.logger.log.info("Pushing new tag to GitHub");

      await execPromise("git", [
        "push",
        "--atomic",
        "--follow-tags",
        "--set-upstream",
        auto.remote,
        getCurrentBranch() || auto.baseBranch,
      ]);
    });
  }
}
```

Once you have the above hooks implemented you should be able to successfully use `auto` to publish a release!

The above plugins is pretty simple and there are a bunch of features you can add to your plugin through hooks or functions that `auto` exports.

## Advanced Release Hooks

### `canary`

This hook enables `canary` releases for your projects.
A `canary` version is a test version you publish for PRs or to test changes.

Your package management platform needs to support a few things for canaries to be possible

1. Separate Releases Lines - you should be able to publish to a release line that doesn't effect your main users (ex: when installing for the first time they should never get a `canary`)
2. Lots of releases - it must support a lot of releases, especially if you make a bunch of PRs

[Read more about the `canary` hook.](./release-lifecycle-hooks#canary)

### `next`

This hook enables `next` releases for your projects.
A `next` release is the next version of your project.
Think of it like an `alpha` or `beta` release line.

Like the `canary` hook your package management platform must support separate release lines.

## Other Useful Hooks

These hooks are not required for publishing plugins, but can really improve the developer experience of it.

### `beforeRun`

Happens before anything is done.
This is a great place to check for platform specific secrets such as a npm token.

```ts
export default class GitTagPlugin implements IPlugin {
  // ...
  apply(auto: Auto) {
    auto.hooks.beforeRun.tap(this.name, () => {
      // Use the `checkEnv` function to warn about missing ENV variables
      auto.checkEnv(this.name, "CLIENT_ID");
    });
  }
}
```

### `getAuthor`

Get git author to commit with.
Typically from a package distribution description file.

```ts
auto.hooks.getAuthor.tapPromise("NPM", async () => {
  const { author } = JSON.parse(await readFile("package.json", "utf-8"));

  if (author) {
    return author;
  }
});
```

### `getRepository`

Get owner and repository for the project to automate releases for.
Typically from a package distribution description file.
Falls back to global `git config` author.

```ts
auto.hooks.getRepository.tapPromise('NPM', async () => {
  const owner = // get the owner from package.json
  const repo = // get the repo from package.json

  return {
    owner,
    repo
  }
});
```
